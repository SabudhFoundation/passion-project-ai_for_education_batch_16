"""
LinkedIn Job Scraper - FastAPI Application
==========================================

This module is the main entry point for the LinkedIn Job Scraper REST API.
It defines all HTTP endpoints, request/response schemas (via Pydantic models),
and wires them to the underlying scraper functions in ``linkdin.py`` and
``jobs_profile.py``.

Running the server
------------------
From the ``fastapi_ends/`` directory, run:

    uvicorn api_endpoint:app --reload

The interactive Swagger UI will be available at:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

The alternative ReDoc documentation will be available at:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

    description="""
## Overview

This API provides programmatic access to **publicly available LinkedIn job listings**
without requiring authentication or an API key. It uses LinkedIn's guest-facing
search and job-posting endpoints and parses the HTML responses to return
clean, structured JSON data.

The API is organized into three logical groups:

- **Scraping** — Search for jobs by keyword, location, and optional filters.
  Returns basic metadata (title, company, location, salary, URL).
- **Enrichment** — Given a list of job URLs, fetch each posting's full text
  description and structured criteria (Seniority, Employment Type, Industry, etc.).
- **Combined Flow** — Perform both operations in one call.

### What a basic job listing looks like

Every job returned by the `/jobs` endpoint has this structure:

```json
{
  "position": "Software Engineer",
  "company": "Google",
  "location": "Bangalore, Karnataka, India",
  "date": "2026-04-15",
  "agoTime": "5 days ago",
  "salary": "Not Listed",
  "jobUrl": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3948576210"
}
```

### What an enriched job listing looks like

After passing a `jobUrl` through `/profiles`, three extra fields are added:

```json
{
  "position": "Software Engineer",
  "company": "Google",
  "location": "Bangalore, Karnataka, India",
  "date": "2026-04-15",
  "agoTime": "5 days ago",
  "salary": "Not Listed",
  "jobUrl": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3948576210",
  "job_id": "3948576210",
  "description": "We are looking for a skilled Software Engineer to join our team...",
  "criteria": {
    "Seniority level": "Mid-Senior level",
    "Employment type": "Full-time",
    "Job function": "Engineering and Information Technology",
    "Industries": "Software Development"
  }
}
```

---

## Authentication

None required. This API consumes LinkedIn's public (guest) endpoints.
No API key, OAuth token, or login session is needed.

> **Note:** Because this API scrapes public pages, its reliability depends on
> LinkedIn's page structure remaining unchanged. If LinkedIn updates their HTML
> layout, some fields may temporarily return empty strings until the parser is updated.

---

## Rate Limiting

LinkedIn's servers will temporarily block IP addresses that make requests
too quickly. To mitigate this, the scraper inserts a **3-second delay**:

- Between paginated search requests (when `num_pages > 1`).
- Between full profile fetches (when enriching multiple jobs).

**Practical time estimates:**

| Operation                        | Approximate time |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| 1-page scrape (~10 jobs)         | 1–2 seconds      |
| 2-page scrape (~20 jobs)         | ~5 seconds       |
| Enriching 5 profiles             | ~15 seconds      |
| Enriching 10 profiles            | ~30 seconds      |
| Enriching 20 profiles            | ~60 seconds      |

**If you receive empty results or errors mid-scrape**, it is likely that LinkedIn
has temporarily rate-limited your IP. Wait a few minutes before retrying.
Always use the `n` parameter to limit enrichment to only what you actually need.

---

## Recommended Workflow

### Two-step (recommended for most use cases)

**Step 1** — Search for jobs:

```json
POST /jobs
{
  "keywords": "Data Scientist",
  "location": "India",
  "num_pages": 2,
  "filters": { "f_E": "2,3", "f_JT": "F", "f_TPR": "r604800" }
}
```

This returns a list of jobs, each with a `jobUrl`. Pick the ones you want.

**Step 2** — Enrich only the jobs you care about:

```json
POST /profiles?n=5
{
  "jobs": [
    { "jobUrl": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3948576210" },
    { "jobUrl": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3948576211" }
  ]
}
```

### One-shot (convenient for small scrapes)

```json
POST /jobs-with-profiles
{
  "keywords": "Machine Learning Engineer",
  "location": "Remote",
  "num_pages": 1,
  "filters": { "f_WT": "2" },
  "n": 5
}
```

> **Tip:** Always set `n` in the one-shot endpoint to avoid waiting for
> 20+ profile fetches. Setting `n=5` scrapes all pages but only enriches the top 5.

---

## Master Filter Reference

The `filters` field accepts any combination of the LinkedIn query parameters below.
Multiple values for a single filter can be combined with commas — e.g., `"f_E": "2,3"` returns
both Entry Level and Associate roles simultaneously.

### Core Search & Sorting

| Parameter  | Type   | Description                                                                                  |

Performs a search against LinkedIn's public job board and returns a list of
basic job listings matching the provided keywords, location, and filters.

### What is returned

Each result contains surface-level metadata only:
- Job title, company name, location
- Posting date (ISO) and relative age (e.g., "3 days ago")
- Salary (if advertised)
- The direct LinkedIn job URL

The full job description and criteria are **not** fetched by this endpoint.
To retrieve those, pass the returned `jobUrl` values to the `/profiles` endpoint.

### Pagination

Set `num_pages` to fetch multiple pages of results. Each page returns approximately
10 listings. A 3-second inter-page delay is applied automatically.

### Errors

- `404` is returned if LinkedIn returns no results for the given query.
- If LinkedIn rate-limits the request mid-scrape, partial results may be returned
  (the scraper stops at the first non-200 response).

@app.post(
    "/jobs/slice",
    summary="Search LinkedIn for Jobs and Return First N Results",
    description="""
Identical to the `POST /jobs` endpoint in every way, but the final result list
is truncated to return only the first `n` results.

### When to use this endpoint

Use this endpoint when you need a predictable, fixed number of results regardless
of how many pages you scrape. For example:

- You want to scrape 3 pages (potentially 30 results) but only need the top 5.
- You are testing your integration and want to limit the output size.

The `n` value is applied **after** scraping all requested pages, so all pages
are still fetched. If you want to avoid scraping extra pages, reduce `num_pages`
in the request body instead.

### Query Parameter

| Parameter | Type    | Required | Description                            |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| `n`       | integer | Yes      | Number of results to return. Must be >= 1. |

### Errors

- `404` is returned if no jobs were found before the slice was applied.

@app.post(
    "/profiles",
    summary="Enrich a List of Jobs with Full Descriptions and Criteria",
    description="""
Takes a list of job objects (each containing a `jobUrl`) and fetches the **complete
job description** and **structured criteria** from each individual LinkedIn job posting page.

### What enrichment adds

For each job, the following additional fields are returned on top of the basic metadata:

- `job_id` — The numeric LinkedIn job ID (extracted from the URL).
- `description` — The complete full-text job description as written by the employer.
- `criteria` — A key-value dictionary of structured criteria from the posting page,
  such as Seniority level, Employment type, Job function, and Industries.

### Time cost

Each profile fetch takes approximately 3 seconds (rate-limit delay). Plan accordingly:

| Jobs to enrich | Approximate time |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 1              | ~1 second        |
| 5              | ~15 seconds      |
| 10             | ~30 seconds      |
| 20             | ~60 seconds      |

Use the `n` query parameter to limit the number of profiles fetched in one call.

### Input format

You can pass the raw output from `POST /jobs` directly as the `jobs` field.
At minimum, each item must have a `jobUrl` field.

### Errors

- `400` is returned if the `jobs` list is empty.
- Individual jobs with a missing or invalid `jobUrl` are silently skipped (they
  are included in the response without enrichment).

@app.post(
    "/jobs-with-profiles",
    summary="Scrape and Enrich Jobs in a Single Request",
    description="""
Combines the full search and enrichment pipeline into a single API call.
This endpoint is the most convenient option when you want enriched results
without making two separate requests.

### How it works

1. **Scrape** — LinkedIn is queried using the provided keywords, location,
   pagination, and filters. This produces a list of basic job listings.
2. **Slice** (optional) — If `n` is provided, only the first `n` jobs from
   the scraped list are carried forward into the enrichment step.
3. **Enrich** — Each selected job is fetched individually to retrieve the
   full description and criteria.

### Performance guidance

Because this endpoint performs both scraping and enrichment sequentially,
the total response time can be significant. Always provide a value for `n`
unless you intentionally want all scraped jobs enriched.

| `num_pages` | Jobs scraped | `n` | Jobs enriched | Approx. time |
|-------------|--------------|-----|---------------|--------------|
| 1           | ~10          | 5   | 5             | ~20 seconds  |
| 2           | ~20          | 5   | 5             | ~23 seconds  |
| 2           | ~20          | 20  | 20            | ~66 seconds  |
| 3           | ~30          | None| 30            | ~96 seconds  |

### Errors

- `404` is returned if the initial scrape returned no jobs.
